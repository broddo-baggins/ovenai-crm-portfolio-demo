-- EMERGENCY RLS FIX - PRODUCTION ISSUE
-- =============================================
-- This script fixes the access control errors blocking dashboard loading
-- Run this directly in Supabase SQL Editor

BEGIN;

-- Step 1: Fix foreign key constraint - remove leads references to test projects
UPDATE public.leads 
SET current_project_id = NULL 
WHERE current_project_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM public.projects 
    WHERE name LIKE '%TDD_%' 
    OR name LIKE '%TEST_%'
    OR name LIKE '%DEMO_%'
    OR created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'

-- Step 2: Delete test projects (now safe from foreign key constraints)
DELETE FROM public.projects 
WHERE name LIKE '%TDD_%' 
OR name LIKE '%TEST_%'
OR name LIKE '%DEMO_%'
OR (created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days' AND name NOT LIKE '%Production%');

-- Step 3: Ensure user has proper client membership
