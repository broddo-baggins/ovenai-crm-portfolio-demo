# Supabase Database Setup & Credentials ✅

## 🔐 Credentials Location

The Supabase database credentials are stored in a local file that is **NOT synced to the repository**:

**File Location:** `/Users/amity/projects/ovenai-crm-portfolio-demo/supabase-credentials.local`

## 📋 Credentials Configuration

- **Database Password:** Stored in `supabase-credentials.local` (not in repo)
- **Supabase URL:** Configured in `.env` file
- **Project Reference:** See your Supabase dashboard
- **Anonymous Key:** Configured in environment variables

## 🛠️ How to Use

### For Local Development:

1. **✅ Anonymous Key is set up** - No action needed

2. **Copy credentials to your environment:**
   - Update your `.env` file with the credentials from `supabase-credentials.local`
   - The `.env` file should contain:
     ```env
     VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
     VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
     ```

3. **Start your development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### For Production:

- Set these as environment variables in your hosting platform (Vercel, etc.)
- **Never commit the actual credentials to the repository**

## 🔒 Security Notes

- The `supabase-credentials.local` file is in `.gitignore`
- This file will **never be synced** to the repository
- The database password is stored securely in this local file
- Always use environment variables for production deployments
