## 🔍 How to Use These Strategies

### For Test Planning
1. Review comprehensive strategy for overall approach
2. Check propagation plan for implementation steps
3. Use regression protection for risk assessment

### For Implementation
1. Follow phase-based approach from propagation plan
2. Implement quality gates from strategy document
3. Set up monitoring per regression protection guidelines

### For Team Alignment
1. Share strategy documents in planning meetings
2. Use as reference for testing decisions
3. Update strategies based on lessons learned

## 🔄 Strategy Updates

Strategies are reviewed and updated:
- Quarterly strategy reviews
- After major project milestones
- Following significant incidents
- Based on industry best practices
