# How to View CRM Data Changes

## The Problem
All data changes ARE in the code and committed, but you're seeing cached/old data.

## Solution: Clear Cache and View Fresh Data

### Option 1: Local Development (FASTEST)
1. Open your browser to: **http://localhost:5173**
2. Press **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac) or **Ctrl+Shift+R** (Windows) to hard refresh
3. Or open DevTools (F12) → Right-click refresh → "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### Option 2: Deploy to Vercel (Live Demo)
```bash
# The changes are already committed and pushed
# Vercel will auto-deploy from the git push we just did
# Check: https://vercel.com/dashboard
```

Visit: https://ovenai-crm-portfolio-demo.vercel.app
Wait 2-3 minutes for Vercel to rebuild and deploy.

### Option 3: Manual Build and Preview
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```
Then visit: http://localhost:4173

## If Still Not Working

1. **Check you're on the right branch:**
```bash
git branch
# Should show: * master
```

2. **Verify latest commit:**
```bash
git log --oneline -1
# Should show: 61af8e4 Add completion summary for CRM fixes
```

3. **Nuclear option - Clear everything:**
```bash
rm -rf node_modules dist
npm install
npm run build
npm run dev
```

4. **Browser incognito mode:**
Open your browser in incognito/private mode to bypass all caches
