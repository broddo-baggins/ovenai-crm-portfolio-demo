## 🎨 User Experience Flow

### First-Time User Journey:

**Visits 1-3:** Floating Tooltip
```
              [×]
          ┌─────────────────┐
          │ 💡 AI Assistant │
          │ Ask me anything │
          │ about this CRM! │
          └────────▲────────┘
                  ✨
```

**Visits 4-8:** Pulsing Animation
```
        ( ) ( ) ( )   ← Animated rings
           ✨         ← Purple glow pulsing
```

**After Click:** Normal State
```
           ✨         ← No more hints
```

## 🔧 How It Works

### RAG Search Process:

1. **User asks question** → "How does BANT scoring work?"

2. **System searches knowledge base**
   ```typescript
   searchKnowledgeBase("How does BANT scoring work?", 3)
   // Returns top 3 relevant documents
   ```

3. **Builds context from matched docs**
   ```typescript
   buildRAGContext([
     { title: "BANT Methodology", content: "..." },
     { title: "HEAT Scoring", content: "..." },
     { title: "Features Overview", content: "..." }
   ])
   ```

4. **Injects into Gemini prompt**
   ```
   System Prompt
   + RAG Documentation Context
   + Conversation History
   + User Question
   + Instructions to use RAG content
   ```

5. **Agent responds with accurate info**
   - Uses documentation for facts
   - Appends sources consulted
   - Provides specific details

### Onboarding State Machine:

```
Visit 1 → Show Tooltip
   ↓
Dismiss → Show Pulse (visits 2-8)
   ↓
Click Agent → Mark Interacted
   ↓
Future Visits → Normal Button
```

## 🧪 Testing the Features

### Test RAG System:

1. **Open the AI Assistant** (Sparkles icon in top bar)

2. **Ask specific questions:**
   ```
   ✅ "How does BANT scoring work in this CRM?"
   ✅ "What's the difference between HEAT and BANT?"
   ✅ "Tell me about the WhatsApp integration"
   ✅ "What technologies were used?"
   ✅ "Is this using real or mock data?"
   ✅ "How do I deploy this to Vercel?"
   ```

3. **Verify responses:**
   - Includes specific details from docs
   - References exact features
   - Lists sources at bottom (when Gemini is enabled)
   - In mock mode, shows "Related Documentation" links

### Test Onboarding:

1. **Clear localStorage** (simulate first-time user)
   ```javascript
   localStorage.removeItem('agent_interacted');
   localStorage.removeItem('agent_visit_count');
   localStorage.removeItem('agent_tooltip_dismissed');
   ```

2. **Reload page**
   - Should see floating tooltip with arrow

3. **Dismiss tooltip**
   - Button should start pulsing with purple glow

4. **Click agent button**
   - Animations should stop
   - Won't show again

---

## 🎛️ Configuration

### Adjust Onboarding Behavior:

Edit `src/hooks/useAgentOnboarding.ts`:

```typescript
const MAX_TOOLTIP_VISITS = 3;  // Show tooltip for N visits
const MAX_PULSE_VISITS = 8;     // Show pulse up to N visits
```

### Add More Knowledge:

Edit `src/services/ragKnowledgeBase.ts`:

```typescript
export const knowledgeBase: DocumentChunk[] = [
  // Add new document chunk
  {
    id: 'new-feature',
    title: 'New Feature',
    content: `Detailed explanation...`,
    source: 'docs/features/new.md',
    category: 'features',
    keywords: ['feature', 'new', 'keyword']
  },
  // ... existing chunks
];
```

## 🎓 Learning Resources

### Understanding RAG:
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) combines:
1. **Retrieval**: Search relevant documents
2. **Augmentation**: Add docs to prompt
3. **Generation**: LLM uses docs for accurate answers

**Benefits**:
- No retraining needed
- Always up-to-date
- Cites sources
- More accurate than pure LLM

### Understanding Progressive Disclosure:
- Show features gradually
- Reduce cognitive overload
- Respect user attention
- Non-intrusive discovery

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### RAG Not Working?

**Problem**: Agent doesn't use documentation  
**Solution**: Check console for search logs
```
🔍 Searching knowledge base for: your question
📚 Found N relevant documents
```

**Problem**: No sources appended  
**Solution**: Enable Gemini API key, sources only show in live mode

### Onboarding Not Showing?

**Problem**: No tooltip/pulsing  
**Solution**: Clear localStorage and reload

**Problem**: Shows every time  
**Solution**: Check `markAsInteracted()` is called on click
