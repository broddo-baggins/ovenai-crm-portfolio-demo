## 🎯 **VERIFICATION COMPLETED**

### **Edge Functions Status**
- ✅ **lead-management/index.ts**: Already uses current_project_id consistently
- ✅ **user-management/index.ts**: Properly creates client_id for new users  
- ✅ **whatsapp-webhook/index.ts**: Focuses on messaging, no project refs needed

### **Database Consistency**
- ✅ **100% test success rate** maintained
- ✅ **No legacy column references** in critical automation scripts
- ✅ **Progressive column detection** working in website verification
- ✅ **Queue system integration** fully operational

---

## 📊 **IMPACT SUMMARY**

### **Before Cleanup**
- ❌ Mixed usage of project_id vs current_project_id
- ❌ Documentation referencing deprecated leads.name column
- ❌ Automation tools using outdated expected schemas
- ❌ Test data scripts creating inconsistent data

### **After Cleanup**  
- ✅ **Consistent current_project_id usage** across all scripts
- ✅ **Clear documentation** of column deprecations
- ✅ **Updated automation tools** with correct schema expectations
- ✅ **Standardized test data creation** using proper columns
- ✅ **Archived legacy documentation** to prevent confusion

---

## 🚀 **REMAINING WORK**

### **Minor Cleanup Items**
1. **Continue archiving legacy docs** in various /OLD/ folders
2. **Update remaining test scripts** that still use project_id for test data
3. **Documentation consolidation** to reduce redundancy

### **Future Considerations**
1. **Database column removal**: Eventually remove legacy project_id column entirely
2. **Performance optimization**: Based on current_project_id usage patterns
3. **API standardization**: Ensure all endpoints use current_project_id consistently
