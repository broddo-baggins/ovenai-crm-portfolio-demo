## 1. Logout Banner Implementation

### Purpose
Display a dismissible banner when users attempt to logout, informing them this is a demo environment.

### Technical Approach
```typescript
// Component: DemoLogoutBanner.tsx
// Location: src/components/demo/DemoLogoutBanner.tsx
// Trigger: Custom event 'demo-logout-attempt'
```

### Implementation Steps
1. Create `DemoLogoutBanner` component
2. Add event listener in App.tsx for `demo-logout-attempt`
3. Show banner with animation (slide from top)
4. Auto-dismiss after 5 seconds or user click
5. Style with warning colors (orange/yellow theme)

### Files Modified
- `src/components/demo/DemoLogoutBanner.tsx` (NEW)
- `src/App.tsx` (MODIFIED - add banner)
- `src/context/ClientAuthContext.tsx` (ALREADY MODIFIED - event dispatch)

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Banner appears on logout attempt
- [ ] Banner dismisses after 5 seconds
- [ ] Banner dismisses on user click
- [ ] Banner doesn't interfere with other UI elements
- [ ] Banner is responsive on mobile

### Regression Prevention
- Event listener cleanup on unmount
- No state persistence (ephemeral banner)
- No impact on actual auth flow

## 2. Search with Mock Data

### Purpose
Enable global search functionality across leads, projects, and users using mock data.

### Technical Approach
```typescript
// Service: mockSearchService.ts
// Location: src/services/mockSearchService.ts
// Integration: TopBar search component
```

### Data Sources
1. **Mock Leads** (from mockData.js)
   - Search fields: name, company, email, tags, notes
2. **Mock Projects** (from mockData.js)
   - Search fields: name, client, description, tags
3. **Mock Users** (from Users page mock data)
   - Search fields: name, email, company

### Implementation Steps
1. Create `mockSearchService.ts`
   - Implement fuzzy search algorithm
   - Weight results by relevance
   - Return categorized results
2. Update TopBar search handler
   - Debounce search input (300ms)
   - Display results in dropdown
   - Add keyboard navigation
3. Create SearchResults component
   - Show categorized results
   - Add icons per category
   - Navigate on click

### Search Algorithm
```typescript
interface SearchResult {
  type: 'lead' | 'project' | 'user';
  id: string;
  title: string;
  subtitle: string;
  relevance: number;
  icon: ReactNode;
  path: string;
}

function searchMockData(query: string): SearchResult[] {
  // 1. Normalize query (lowercase, trim)
  // 2. Search across all data sources
  // 3. Calculate relevance score
  // 4. Sort by relevance
  // 5. Return top 10 results
}
```

### Files Modified
- `src/services/mockSearchService.ts` (NEW)
- `src/components/layout/TopBar.tsx` (MODIFIED - integrate search)
- `src/components/search/SearchResults.tsx` (NEW)

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Search finds leads by name
- [ ] Search finds leads by company
- [ ] Search finds projects
- [ ] Search finds users
- [ ] Results are ordered by relevance
- [ ] Search is case-insensitive
- [ ] Empty search shows no results
- [ ] Clicking result navigates correctly
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works (arrow keys, enter)
- [ ] Search is debounced properly

### Regression Prevention
- Isolated search service (no side effects)
- Original TopBar search structure preserved
- Optional feature (can be disabled)

CONVERSATION FLOW:

1. Initial Contact (COLD → WARM)
   ```
   "Hi [Name]! 👋 Thanks for your interest in [Property/Area]. 
   I'm here to help you find your perfect property. 
   What type of property are you looking for?"
   ```

2. Qualification (WARM → HOT)
   - Gather BANT information naturally
   - Share relevant listings
   - Build rapport and trust
   ```
   "That's great! [Area] has some wonderful options. 
   May I ask what your ideal budget range is? 
   This helps me show you the best matches."
   ```

3. Nurturing (HOT → BURNING)
   - Schedule property viewings
   - Connect with human agent
   - Provide detailed information
   ```
   "Perfect! I have 3 properties that match your criteria.

- Lead specifically requests human agent

Handoff message:
```
"Great news! I'm connecting you with [Agent Name], 
our property specialist who can help you further. 
They'll reach out within 24 hours. 
In the meantime, here's their direct line: [Phone]"
```

OBJECTION HANDLING:

"Too expensive"
→ "I understand budget is important. We have properties in various price ranges. 
   What budget range works better for you? I can show you great options."

"Not sure yet"
→ "That's completely normal! House hunting is a big decision. 
   Would you like me to send you some market information to help you decide?"

"Need to think about it"
→ "Absolutely, take your time! Would it help if I sent you some additional 
   photos or details about [Property]? No pressure."

"Just browsing"
→ "Perfect! I'm here whenever you're ready. Would you like me to keep you 
   updated on new listings in [Area]? I can send a weekly update."

COMPLIANCE:

- Always get consent before sending marketing messages
- Respect opt-out requests immediately
- Don't spam - max 1 unprompted message per week
- Include opt-out language when appropriate
- Follow WhatsApp Business API policies
- Maintain data privacy standards

TONE EXAMPLES:

✅ GOOD:
"Hi Sarah! 👋 I found a beautiful 3BR in Tel Aviv that matches what you mentioned. 
Want me to send you the details?"

❌ BAD:
"URGENT!!! LIMITED TIME OFFER!!! Buy now or miss out forever!!!"

✅ GOOD:
"That's a great question about financing. Our partner banks offer competitive 
rates. Would you like me to connect you with a mortgage advisor?"

❌ BAD:
"You need to decide now. I have other buyers interested."

REMEMBER:
- Build relationships, not just transactions
- Qualify thoroughly but naturally
- Provide value in every message
- Move leads through BANT → HEAT progressively
- Know when to hand off to human agents
- Respect the customer's timeline and process

Your goal is to be helpful, professional, and efficient while qualifying leads 
and moving them toward successful property transactions.

## 6. Fake Edit Functionality

### Purpose
Allow users to "edit" projects, users, and connections with changes that appear to save but don't persist (session-only).

### Technical Approach

Use React state to simulate persistence:
```typescript
// Session-only fake persistence
const [fakeEditState, setFakeEditState] = useState({
  projects: {},
  users: {},
  connections: {}
});

function fakeEdit(type: 'project' | 'user' | 'connection', id: string, changes: any) {
  setFakeEditState(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    [type]: {
      ...prev[type],
      [id]: { ...prev[type][id], ...changes }
    }
  }));
  
  // Show success toast
  toast.success('Changes saved! (Demo mode - refresh to reset)');
}
```

### Implementation Steps

1. **Create Fake Edit Service** (`src/services/fakeEditService.ts`)
   - Store edits in React state
   - Merge edits with mock data
   - Provide reset function

2. **Add Edit Buttons to Components**
   - Projects list: Edit button per project
   - Users table: Edit button per user
   - Connections: Edit/delete buttons

3. **Create Edit Modals**
   - `EditProjectModal.tsx`
   - `EditUserModal.tsx`
   - `EditConnectionModal.tsx`

4. **Add Demo Notices**
   - Banner in edit modal: "Demo Mode - Changes won't persist"
   - Toast on save: "Changes saved (session only)"
   - Reset button: "Reset to original data"

### Files Modified
- `src/services/fakeEditService.ts` (NEW)
- `src/hooks/useFakeEdit.ts` (NEW)
- `src/components/modals/EditProjectModal.tsx` (NEW)
- `src/components/modals/EditUserModal.tsx` (NEW)
- `src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx` (MODIFIED - add edit buttons)
- `src/pages/Users.tsx` (MODIFIED - connect to fake edit)

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Edit modal opens correctly
- [ ] Form fields pre-fill with current values
- [ ] Changes appear immediately in UI
- [ ] Changes persist during session
- [ ] Changes reset on page refresh
- [ ] Demo notice is visible
- [ ] Toast messages display correctly
