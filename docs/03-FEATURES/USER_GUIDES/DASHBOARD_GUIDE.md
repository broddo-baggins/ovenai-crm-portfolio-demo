## 🔥 **Heat Cards System**

### **What are Heat Cards?**
Heat Cards are visual representations of your lead "temperature" - how engaged and likely to convert they are.

### **Heat Levels**
- 🟦 **Cold (0-30%)** - New leads, minimal engagement
- 🟨 **Warm (31-60%)** - Some interaction, moderate interest
- 🟧 **Hot (61-80%)** - High engagement, likely to convert
- 🔥 **Burning (81-100%)** - Extremely hot, immediate attention required

### **How Heat is Calculated**
The AI considers:
- **Message Response Time** - Faster responses = higher heat
- **Conversation Length** - More messages = higher engagement
- **Meeting Scheduling** - Booked appointments increase heat
- **Project Interest** - Asking about specific properties
- **Time Since Last Contact** - Recent contact maintains heat

### **Using Heat Cards**
1. **Prioritize Your Day** - Focus on hottest leads first
2. **Quick Visual Assessment** - Instantly see lead status
3. **Click to Act** - Tap any heat card to view/contact lead
4. **Track Changes** - Watch heat increase/decrease over time
