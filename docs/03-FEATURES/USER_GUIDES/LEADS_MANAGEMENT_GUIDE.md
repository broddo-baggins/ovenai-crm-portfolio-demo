## üî• **Understanding Lead Heat Scoring**

### **What is Lead Heat?**
Lead Heat is OvenAI's AI-powered scoring system that determines how likely a lead is to convert based on engagement patterns.

### **Heat Categories**
- üü¶ **Cold (0-30%)** - Recently added, minimal engagement
- üü® **Warm (31-60%)** - Some interaction, showing interest
- üüß **Hot (61-80%)** - High engagement, ready to buy
- üî• **Burning (81-100%)** - Extremely hot, immediate action required

### **Heat Factors**
The AI considers:
- **Response Speed** - How quickly they reply to messages
- **Message Quality** - Detailed responses vs short replies
- **Meeting Requests** - Asking for appointments
- **Project Interest** - Inquiring about specific properties
- **Frequency** - How often they initiate contact
