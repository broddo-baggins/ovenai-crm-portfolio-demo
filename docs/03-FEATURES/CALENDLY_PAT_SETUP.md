# Calendly Personal Access Token (PAT) Setup Guide

   - Log in to your Calendly account

2. **Generate Token**
   - Click on "API & Webhooks"
   - Click "Create Token"
   - Copy the generated token (it starts with `eyJ` followed by your unique token)

### Step 2: Connect in OvenAI

1. **Navigate to Calendar**
   - Go to `/calendar` in your OvenAI app
   - You'll see the Calendly integration card

2. **Enter Your Token**
   - Click "Connect Calendly"
   - Paste your Personal Access Token
   - Click "Connect Calendly"

3. **Success!**
   - Your calendar events will now sync automatically
   - You can share your booking link directly from conversations

## üìä Comparison with OAuth

### PAT Method (Current)
```javascript
// Simple API call with PAT
const response = await fetch('https://api.calendly.com/users/me', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${personalAccessToken}`
  }
});
```

### OAuth Method (Complex)
```javascript
// OAuth requires multiple steps
1. Redirect to Calendly for authorization
2. Handle callback with authorization code
3. Exchange code for access token
4. Handle token refresh when expired
5. Store and manage multiple tokens
```

## üîí Security Best Practices

1. **Token Protection**
   - Never share your PAT with others
   - Don't commit tokens to version control
   - Regenerate tokens if compromised

2. **Access Control**
   - PAT tokens are read-only by default
   - Cannot modify or delete your calendar events
   - Limited to your own Calendly account data

3. **Monitoring**
   - Check token usage in Calendly settings
   - Monitor for unusual API activity
   - Revoke tokens when no longer needed

## üéØ Next Steps

After connecting Calendly:

1. **Test the Integration**
   - Visit the Calendar page
   - Verify your events are showing
   - Try scheduling a test meeting

2. **Configure WhatsApp**
   - Go to a conversation in Messages
   - Click "Schedule Meeting"
   - Test the booking flow

3. **Share Your Link**
   - Copy your booking link from Calendar
   - Share it in WhatsApp conversations
   - Track bookings in the dashboard
