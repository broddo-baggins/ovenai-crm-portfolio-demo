# System Administration Console Guide

## Overview

The System Administration Console is the central hub for managing your OvenAI platform infrastructure. It provides real-time monitoring, user management, database operations, and administrative tools - all accessible through a secure web interface.

## üîê Access Control & Security

### Who Can Access the Admin Console?

**Only System Administrators** can access the admin console. Access is controlled by:

1. **Database Role Check**: User must have `role = 'admin'` in the profiles table
2. **Metadata Verification**: User metadata must contain admin flags
3. **Authentication Requirement**: Must be logged in with valid Supabase session

### Creating Admin Users

To create new admin users:

1. **Navigate to Users Tab** in the admin console
2. **Click "Create Admin User"** (red button - indicates high privilege)
3. **Fill Required Information**:
   - Full Name
   - Email Address
   - Admin Level (Full Administrator or Limited Administrator)
4. **Security Confirmation**: Check "I understand this grants full administrative access"
5. **Optional**: Toggle "Send Login Credentials" to email login details

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Warning**: Admin users have full system access including user management, database operations, and configuration changes.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### Admin Access Management

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Only grant admin access when necessary
2. **Regular Access Review**: Periodically review who has admin access
3. **Strong Authentication**: Require strong passwords and consider 2FA
4. **Session Management**: Monitor active admin sessions

### Operational Security

1. **Confirmation Required**: All destructive operations require explicit confirmation
2. **Audit Logging**: All admin actions are logged with user attribution
3. **Safe Defaults**: Operations default to safe modes (dry-run, preview)
4. **Emergency Procedures**: Document emergency access and recovery procedures

### Data Protection

1. **Sensitive Data Masking**: User passwords and secrets are never displayed
2. **Secure Communications**: All admin operations use encrypted connections
3. **Access Logging**: Detailed logs of all data access and modifications
4. **Backup Security**: Backups are encrypted and securely stored

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Admin Console Won't Load
1. **Check User Role**: Verify user has `role = 'admin'` in database
2. **Clear Browser Cache**: Hard refresh or clear application cache
3. **Check Console Errors**: Look for JavaScript errors in browser console
4. **Verify Session**: Ensure valid Supabase authentication session

#### System Metrics Not Updating
1. **Database Connection**: Verify database connectivity
2. **Service Status**: Check if monitoring services are running
3. **Permissions**: Ensure database queries have proper permissions
4. **Network Issues**: Check for network connectivity problems

#### User Creation Fails
1. **Email Validation**: Ensure email format is correct and unique
2. **Database Constraints**: Check for database constraint violations
3. **Service Availability**: Verify user management services are running
4. **Quota Limits**: Check if user quotas have been exceeded

### Emergency Procedures

#### System-Wide Issues
1. **Check System Health tab** for immediate status overview
2. **Run Health Check Script** for comprehensive diagnostics
3. **Review Recent Changes** in admin activity logs
4. **Escalate to Technical Team** if issues persist

#### Data Issues
1. **Run Integrity Check** to identify data corruption
2. **Check Recent Backups** for restore options
3. **Review Data Operations** for recent changes
4. **Document Issues** for post-incident review
