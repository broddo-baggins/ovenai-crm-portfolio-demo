# Groq Fallback for CRM Agent

## ✅ Implementation Status: COMPLETED

## Current State
The CRM Demo Assistant (`geminiService.ts`) now uses a robust three-tier fallback system:
1. Google Gemini AI (Primary)
2. Groq AI (Secondary fallback)
3. Mock responses (Final fallback)

This provides high availability and reliability for the AI assistant functionality.

### Benefits Achieved
- ✅ **Higher uptime**: Groq provides 14,400 requests/day vs Gemini's 50 requests/day (free tier)
- ✅ **Faster inference**: Groq uses optimized LPU (Language Processing Unit) for sub-second responses
- ✅ **Better UX**: Real AI responses instead of static mock responses when Gemini quota is exhausted
- ✅ **Graceful degradation**: Seamless fallback chain ensures the assistant is always available

### Implementation Completed

1. ✅ **Installed Groq SDK**
   - `groq-sdk` package added to dependencies

2. ✅ **Environment Configuration**
   - Added `VITE_GROQ_API_KEY` to `env.ts`
   - Added Groq configuration checks (`isGroqConfigured`)
   - Added AI status to debug info

3. ✅ **Updated `geminiService.ts`**
   - Imported Groq SDK
   - Initialized Groq client with browser compatibility
   - Implemented three-tier fallback system:
     - Primary: Gemini with RAG
     - Secondary: Groq with RAG and conversation context
     - Final: Mock responses
   - Added proper error logging and user feedback
   - Maintained RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) support across all tiers

### Fallback Chain (Implemented)
1. **Gemini** (Primary) - High quality, 50 req/day
   - Uses RAG with knowledge base
   - Temperature: 0.7, Max tokens: 2048
   
2. **Groq** (Secondary) - Fast, 14,400 req/day  
   - Model: `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`
   - Maintains RAG context and conversation history
   - Temperature: 0.7, Max tokens: 2048
   - Powered by LPU (Language Processing Unit)
   
3. **Mock Responses** (Final) - Always available
   - Context-aware responses for common questions
   - Covers BANT, HEAT, tech stack, features

### Configuration Required

To enable Groq fallback in production (Vercel), ensure the environment variable is set:

```bash
# In Vercel Dashboard > Settings > Environment Variables
VITE_GROQ_API_KEY=<your_groq_api_key>
```

The variable is already configured in your Vercel project according to your setup.

### Testing

You can test the fallback chain by:
1. Testing with valid Gemini key → Should use Gemini
2. Testing with invalid/missing Gemini key → Should fallback to Groq
3. Testing with both invalid → Should use mock responses

Console logs will show which tier is being used:
- `✅ Gemini response received`
- `✅ Groq response received` (with "Powered by Groq" indicator)
- `📋 Using mock responses`
