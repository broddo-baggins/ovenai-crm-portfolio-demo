  // BANT Scoring
  {
    id: 'bant-methodology',
    title: 'BANT Qualification Methodology',
    content: `BANT is a B2B sales qualification framework that stands for:

**B**udget - Does the lead have financial resources?
- Scored 0-100% based on budget clarity
- Higher scores indicate confirmed budget availability
- Helps prioritize leads with purchasing power

**A**uthority - Are we talking to the decision-maker?
- Scored 0-100% based on decision-making power
- Identifies key stakeholders and influencers
- Ensures conversations with the right people

**N**eed - Do they have a genuine need for our solution?
- Scored 0-100% based on pain points and requirements
- Validates product-market fit
- Qualifies leads based on actual needs

**T**imeline - When are they looking to purchase?
- Scored 0-100% based on urgency and timeframe
- Helps forecast revenue and plan resources
- Identifies immediate vs. future opportunities

**Implementation in CRM:**
- Each lead has individual BANT scores (B, A, N, T percentages)
- Composite BANT score automatically calculated
- Scores visible in lead details and dashboard analytics
- Used for lead prioritization and pipeline forecasting
- Integration with HEAT scoring for comprehensive qualification`,

  // HEAT Scoring
  {
    id: 'heat-temperature',
    title: 'HEAT Temperature Scoring System',
    content: `The HEAT scoring system represents lead temperature and indicates engagement level:

🧊 **Cold (0-25%)** - Initial contact, gathering information
- Just entered the system
- Limited engagement
- Early discovery phase
- Focus: Education and relationship building

🌤️ **Warm (26-50%)** - Showing interest, engaged in conversation
- Regular communication
- Asking questions about features
- Considering options
- Focus: Demonstration and value proposition

🔥 **Hot (51-75%)** - Actively considering, ready for demos
- High engagement frequency
- Discussing pricing and terms
- Meeting with decision-makers
- Focus: Proposal and negotiation

🌋 **Burning (76-100%)** - Ready to buy, high urgency
- Immediate purchase intent
- Budget approved
- Decision imminent
- Focus: Closing and onboarding

**How It Works:**
- Heat scores calculated based on BANT qualification + engagement frequency + behavior patterns
- Automatically updated as leads progress
- Used to prioritize follow-ups and allocate sales resources
- Triggers automated workflows (e.g., hot lead notifications)
- Forecasts conversion probability

**Visual Indicators:**
- Color-coded badges in lead lists
- Dashboard heat distribution charts
- Real-time temperature changes
- Historical heat trends`,
