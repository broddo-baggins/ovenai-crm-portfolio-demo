**N**eed - Do they have a genuine need for our solution?
**T**imeline - When are they looking to purchase?

In this CRM demo, each lead has BANT scores (0-100%) that help sales teams prioritize their efforts. You can see these scores in the lead details and dashboard analytics.

The system automatically calculates a composite BANT score that helps determine lead quality and prioritization.`;

üî• **Hot (51-75%)** - Actively considering, ready for demos
üåã **Burning (76-100%)** - Ready to buy, high urgency

This demo uses heat scores to:
- Prioritize follow-ups
- Trigger automated workflows
- Allocate sales resources
- Forecast conversion probability
