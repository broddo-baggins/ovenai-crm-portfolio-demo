# ✅ CRITICAL FIXES DEPLOYED

## Problems Fixed

### 1. ❌ Leads Showing 0 → ✅ NOW SHOWS 20
**Problem**: 
```
📊 Loaded 0 leads for project: TechStart Solutions
```
**Root Cause**: Leads were being filtered by project ID, but mock lead project IDs didn't match

**Solution**: Added demo mode check to `loadLeadsInternal()`:
```javascript
// 🎭 DEMO MODE: Return all mock leads immediately (no filtering by project)
if (import.meta.env.VITE_DEMO_MODE === 'true') {
  console.log('🎭 [DEMO MODE] Returning all 20 mock leads (no project filtering)');
  return mockDataService.getMockLeads();
}
```

**Result**: All 20 leads now show on Leads page, regardless of selected project

---

### 2. ❌ Messages/Conversations Error → ✅ NOW SHOWS 4 CONVERSATIONS
**Problem**:
```
❌ Error fetching conversations: {message: "TypeError: Load failed"}
📭 No conversations available for WhatsApp messages
```

**Root Cause**: `getAllConversations()` was trying to fetch from Supabase

**Solution**: Added demo mode check to `getAllConversations()`:
```javascript
// 🎭 DEMO MODE: Return mock conversations immediately
if (import.meta.env.VITE_DEMO_MODE === 'true') {
  console.log('🎭 [DEMO MODE] Returning mock conversations');
  return mockDataService.getMockConversations();
}
```

**Result**: Messages page now shows 4 full conversation threads

---

### 3. ℹ️ Calendar Events - Already Working
**Status**: Calendar events were already included in mock data
- 10 dynamic events using current date + offsets
- Events show on calendar with hover details
- No additional fixes needed

   - Harmless, doesn't affect functionality

   - Fallback to mock data works correctly
