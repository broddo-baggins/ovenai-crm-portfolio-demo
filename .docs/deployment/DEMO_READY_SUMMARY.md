- Project cards show progress bars
- Calendar has events
- Charts render with data points

### ⚠️ Issues to Report:
- Any page showing "0" for data that should have numbers
- Console errors (red text)
- Pages not loading
- Blank charts or tables
- Authentication errors

## Debugging

If you see zeros or missing data:

1. **Check Console**:
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Look for demo mode messages
   - Check for errors in red

2. **Clear Cache**:
   ```bash
   # Stop server (Ctrl+C)
   # Clear browser cache
   # Clear localStorage
   localStorage.clear()
   # Restart server
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Verify Environment**:
   ```bash
   # Should see VITE_DEMO_MODE mentioned
   npm run dev | head -20
   ```

4. **Check Build**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   # Test on localhost:4173
   ```

## Console Commands for Testing

```bash
# In browser console after login:

# Check if demo mode is active
console.log(import.meta.env.VITE_DEMO_MODE)
// Should show: "true"

# Manually test mock data service
import { mockDataService } from '@/services/mockDataService'
mockDataService.getMockLeads()
// Should show array of 20 leads

# Check localStorage for cached stats
localStorage.getItem('quick-stats-all-undefined')
// Should show JSON with stats
```
