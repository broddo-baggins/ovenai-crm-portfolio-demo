## Expected Behavior After Deployment

### Scenario 1: Normal Operation (Gemini Available)
```
User asks question
   ↓
Search knowledge base (RAG)
   ↓
Try Gemini API
   ↓
✅ Success → Return response
```

**Console Output**:
```
🔍 Searching knowledge base for: [question]
📚 Found 3 relevant documents
🤖 Querying Gemini AI with RAG context...
✅ Gemini response received
```

### Scenario 2: Groq Fallback (Gemini Unavailable)
```
User asks question
   ↓
Search knowledge base (RAG)
   ↓
Try Gemini API → ❌ Fails (quota/error)
   ↓
Try Groq API
   ↓
✅ Success → Return response with "Powered by Groq" indicator
```

**Console Output**:
```
🔍 Searching knowledge base for: [question]
📚 Found 3 relevant documents
🤖 Querying Gemini AI with RAG context...
⚠️ Gemini failed, trying Groq fallback...
🔄 Attempting Groq fallback...
✅ Groq response received
```

### Scenario 3: Mock Responses (Both APIs Down)
```
User asks question
   ↓
Search knowledge base (RAG)
   ↓
Try Gemini API → ❌ Fails
   ↓
Try Groq API → ❌ Fails
   ↓
Return mock response based on question keywords
```

**Console Output**:
```
🔍 Searching knowledge base for: [question]
📚 Found 3 relevant documents
🤖 Querying Gemini AI with RAG context...
⚠️ Gemini failed, trying Groq fallback...
🔄 Attempting Groq fallback...
❌ Groq also failed: [error]
📋 Using mock responses (both Gemini and Groq unavailable)
```

## API Capacity

| Provider | Daily Limit | Your Status | Active |
|----------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| Gemini | ~50 requests | Configured | ✅ Primary |
| Groq | 14,400 requests | **Configured** | ✅ **Fallback** |
| Mock | Unlimited | Always Ready | ✅ Final |
| **TOTAL** | **~14,450 req/day** | **READY** | ✅ |

## Personality Examples

### Question: "What is BANT scoring?"

**Expected Response Style**:
> "Ah, BANT - Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline. The time-tested framework that lets sales teams pretend they're being 'data-driven' while still relying on gut feeling.
> 
> Here's how we implemented it: Each dimension scores 0-100%, then we calculate a weighted composite (Budget 30%, Need 30%, Authority 25%, Timeline 15%).
> 
> Originally, these scores updated in real-time from Supabase. Now they update in real-time from mockData.js. The algorithm is identical, the database is... theoretical."

### Question: "Why use mock data?"

**Expected Response Style**:
> "Excellent question! Let's talk about the Great Database Pivot.
> 
> What We Had: Full Supabase PostgreSQL with RLS, real-time subscriptions, webhooks. Very production.
> 
> The Reality Check: Recruiters have 30-second attention spans. 'Hold on while I set up database credentials' loses them instantly.
> 
> The Smart Pivot: Replace backend with sophisticated mock data. Same UI, same code quality, zero latency, runs anywhere. And the Supabase code? Still there in src/integrations/supabase/, ready to reconnect.
> 
> Could it be production? Sure! 6-8 weeks. But right now it's the best-running demo that doesn't talk to a server."

### Question: "Tell me about WhatsApp"

**Expected Response Style**:
> "The WhatsApp integration - the one that got away. Let me tell you about Meta's Business API.
> 
> What Exists:
> - Full webhook handler (src/api/whatsapp/)
> - BANT conversation flows
> - Template management
> - 90+ mock conversations
> 
> What's Missing: Meta's blessing. They want business verification (weeks), public webhooks (hosting), extensive docs, and probably your firstborn.
> 
> The Solution: Keep all the code (production-ready), show the UI (beautiful), demonstrate with mocks (realistic).
> 
> Want to see it work? Messages page. Want the code? src/api/whatsapp/. Want it real? Get Meta verification and flip IS_MOCK flag."

## Next Steps

### To Deploy:
```bash
cd /Users/amity/projects/crm-portfolio-demo

git add .

git commit -m "feat: Add Groq fallback + GLaDOS personality to AI assistant

- Implemented three-tier fallback: Gemini → Groq → Mock
- Upgraded AI personality with technical depth and wit  
- Added comprehensive design/PM decision documentation
- Integrated OvenAI architecture knowledge
- AI explains Supabase→Mock pivot and Meta WhatsApp story
- 14,450 requests/day capacity across all tiers"

git push origin main
```

### To Test Locally:
```bash
# Optional: Add Groq key to .env.local (use your actual key from Vercel)
echo "VITE_GROQ_API_KEY=<your_groq_key_here>" >> .env.local

# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000
# Click AI assistant (sparkle icon)
# Ask questions and check console (F12)
```

### To Test in Production:
```bash
# After deploying to Vercel:
# 1. Open https://crm-portfolio-demo.vercel.app
# 2. Open AI assistant
# 3. Ask test questions
# 4. Check browser console for tier indicators
# 5. Monitor Groq console: https://console.groq.com/
```
